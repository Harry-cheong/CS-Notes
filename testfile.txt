    2. Garbage-collected
    - Cleaning the memory so we don't have to

    3. Interpreted or just-in-time complied
    - higher abstraction

    4. Multi-paradigm 
    - An approach and mindset of structuring code, which will direct your coding sytle and technique 
    - Paradigms consist of Procedural Programming, Object Oriented Programming and Functional Programming

    5. Protype-based object-Oriented
    <> Object Oriented Programming

    6. First-class functions
    - functions are simply treated as variables

    7. Dynamic
    - data types are automatically determined during runtime

    8. Single-threaded
    - JavaScript runs in one single thread, so it can only do one thing at a time

    9. Non-blocking event loop
